                    <p>My name is Byron Sosa and I live in the Bay Area. I went to UC 
                            Davis for my bachelor's degree in Biochemical Engineering and work
                            as a chemist for a mid-size contract lab located in Hercules, CA.
                    </p>

                    <p>I am currently enrolled in a 3 month coding bootcamp at UC Berkeley to
                           improve my knowledge of coding and go into a tech-related career path.
